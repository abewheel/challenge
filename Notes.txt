DESIGN NOTES
------------

CONTROLLERS
- I like to distinguish between internal API calls and external ones and have put the 
GeoController inside 'module API' and created two endpoints:

  GET /api/geo
  GET /api/ips

DATABASE/MODELS
- None for this prototype.

CACHE
I had a simple cache implementation based on Redis and wanted to use that. But one
of the project requirements was to return everything in the cache (all IP's) and
I didn't see an easy way for Redis to do this; we'd have to get all the keys and look up the
values one by one. I didn't want to spend any more time and decided to use a global hash instead.

ISSUES
- RestClient::SSLCertificateNotVerified
I ran into this issue in /lib/geo_js.rb and the best solution is to have actual certificates in place. 
One of the fastest ways of doing this is to have self-signed certs, but that didn't work. So I had to
made a comprimise and verify SSL only when in production mode (on Heroku).
